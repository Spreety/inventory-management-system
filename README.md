The purpose of this app is to provide an inventory management system. It allows the user to add, delete and modify products and parts. Each product has parts associated with it. There is a check that does not allow products to be deleted if it still has parts associated with it. 

This was my Software 1 project for my BS in Software Developement. 

**Main Screen**
This screen lists parts and products. From this screen, you are able to add, modify or delete parts or products. You can also do a search for either parts or products.

This screen allows you to add new parts. The ID number is auto-populated. The fields change based on the radial button selection of In-house or Outsourced. You will get an alert if your min is higher than your max amount.
